## Big Data Analytics Practicals
Welcome to the Big Data Analytics (BDA) practical repository!
This repository is designed to provide a foundational understanding of core concepts in BDA using tools like Python, Jupyter Notebook, and Weka. The Practicals follow a beginner-friendly sequence, helping you step-by-step to explore statistical techniques, data preprocessing, and machine learning models essential for data analytics.

## What to Learn
This repository includes hands-on practicals covering the following topics:
1. Introduction to Big Data Analytics
•	Overview of Big Data
•	Importance and Applications of BDA
•	Tools and Ecosystem (Python, Jupyter, Weka)

2. Basic Statistical Tests
•	T-Test: Comparing means between two groups
•	Z-Test: Testing population means when variance is known
•	ANOVA (F-Test): Comparing means across multiple groups

3. Data Understanding
•	Confusion Matrix: Performance evaluation of classification models
•	Correlation Matrix: Understanding relationships between variables
•	Normal Distribution: Data distribution analysis and visualization

4. Machine Learning Models
•	Linear Regression: Predicting continuous values
•	Logistic Regression: Binary classification tasks
•	Naive Bayes Classifier: Probabilistic classification
•	K-Fold Cross Validation: Model evaluation and generalization

5. Working with Weka
•	Installing and exploring the Weka GUI
•	Loading datasets (ARFF, CSV)
•	Running classifiers and visualizing results

## Tools & Technologies Used
Tool:
•	Python Programming language for analytics and modeling

•	Jupyter Notebook   Interactive coding and documentation

•	Weka    GUI-based machine learning tool for experimentation

•	Libraries Used pandas, numpy, scipy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn


## Getting Started
1.	Clone this repository:
2.	git clone https://github.com/skandalkar/Big-Data-Analytics-.git
3.	Set up Python environment:
4.	pip install -r requirements
5.	Open Jupyter Notebook:
6.	Jupyter notebook
7.	Install Weka from official website and follow the guide in Weka Tool

## Notes
•	Datasets used are either generated or from open-source repositories (e.g., Kaggle).
•	The code is commented for clarity and learning purposes.
